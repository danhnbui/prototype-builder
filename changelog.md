## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-06

### Added
- **Preview dev server** (`pb/tools/serve.py`, `/pb:preview`): watches `registry.json` (+ the shell
  template + `render.py`) and live-reloads the browser on every change over Server-Sent Events. Renders
  **in memory** through the same generator as `/pb:build --render` (so the preview is byte-identical and
  costs ~0 model tokens), never clobbering the on-disk `prototype.html`. `--write` opts into also keeping
  `prototype.html` fresh; a bad registry mid-edit shows a recoverable error page instead of crashing.
  Stdlib-only — no new dependencies.
- Figma hand-off render audit (**G-FP6**): a mandatory, machine-checkable read-back after the push —
  auto-layout on every frame · 0 absolute children · 0 raw values (color/space/radius all bound to
  variables) · variants in a ComponentSet · screen elements as instances · bound-token count ≥ the
  G-FP3 union. A failing invariant HARD-FAILs and **blocks the Step 7 contract write-back**, so a
  hand-off is "done" only when the pushed result verifies — making the gated process the enforced
  path, not merely the recommended one.

### Changed
- `render.py` refactored to expose a pure `build_html(reg, shell)` (the single render truth shared by the
  CLI and the dev server) and a `RenderError`; the `render.py` CLI output is unchanged.
- `serve.py` hardened to run under a sandboxed launcher (e.g. a macOS preview pane TCC-blocked from
  `~/Desktop`): resolve all paths to absolute, then `chdir` to an accessible dir so an unreadable inherited
  cwd no longer crashes startup (`os.getcwd()` EPERM); path display + static root are cwd-free. Relative
  and absolute invocations both verified.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-05

A standalone, CLAUDE.md-native rebuild of the SpecKit Prototype Builder. A plumbing swap, not a rewrite —
the crown-jewel logic ported unchanged. See [docs/CHANGES-from-v0.4.0.md](docs/CHANGES-from-v0.4.0.md).

### Added
- `registry.json` as the single source of truth for prototype state.
- Deterministic render generator (`pb/tools/render.py`): `registry.json` → `prototype.html` at ~0 model tokens.
- Claude Code **plugin** packaging (`pb@product-builder`); the `/pb:*` command surface (12 commands).
- `/pb:build-check-design-system` — DS-first reuse / variant / build-local + naming contract.
- Two-mode `/pb:hand-off` — `--people` (view-only + cover) and `--context` (portable bundle).
- Memory layer: `memory/constitution.md` (Principles + Stack/DS locks) and `memory/decisions.md`.
- `config` block (`viewOnly`, `cover`, `iconCdn`) for a DS-agnostic, shareable output.

### Changed
- `scaffold` → `init`; `figma-push` → `build-figma-handoff` (DS-neutral).
- Tabs renamed: User Flow → UX Design, Design Handoff → UI Design, ERD → Data.
- Tab-2 (Project Summary) sync folded into `init` / `specify` / `clarify` command bodies (no hooks).
- Design-system-agnostic core: neutral tokens (`--neutral-*`, `--shadow-*`, `--radius-*`), configurable icons.

### Removed
- SpecKit: `extension.yml`, `preset.yml`, the `after_*` hooks, `sync-tab2`, `skills-refresh`.
- All HIVE / PropertyGuru hardcoding.

### Fixed
- Render generator: inline `registry.json` safely (`</` → `<\/`) without double-escaping JSON — fixes any
  registry value containing embedded quotes or newlines (e.g. flow/erd HTML).
- Tab 1 (Prototype) now renders `registry.screens` as the **live interactive app** (with a screen
  switcher for multi-screen prototypes) instead of a hand-edited placeholder — caught by an end-to-end
  self-test build.
- Figma handoff identity: `figma-transfer.template.json` now stores `dsMatch.figmaComponentId` (matching
  what `build-figma-handoff` and the `figma-use` skill read) — the prior `componentId` mismatch would have
  re-created components instead of updating them in place.
- Figma handoff token coverage (G-FP3): collect the **union** of declared tokens + every `var(--…)` used in
  the render bodies, so tokens that are used but not separately declared (spacing, semantic colors, shadows)
  are no longer silently skipped — caught by the dry-run test (3 → 17 tokens on the selftest fixture).

## [0.4.0] — prior baseline (SpecKit Prototype Builder)

The SpecKit preset + extension: a 5-tab single-file `template.html`, `after_*` hooks, and `figma-push`.
Retained, untouched, in its own repo (`spec-kit-extension-prototype-builder`).
